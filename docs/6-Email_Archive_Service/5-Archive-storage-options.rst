Archive storage options
=======================

If you have purchased the archiving product, it will be available in
your Spampanel control panel. Initially you have to decide the type of
storage to be used. Each node within the SpamExperts Local Cloud can be
used to store the archiving data. If you wish use external storage for
the archiving, this storage has to be directly mountable on the
SpamExperts Local Cloud node.

It is possible to store the data mirrored on multiple SpamExperts nodes
for redundancy (however we recommend using redudant hardware storage
instead), it is also possible to store the data striped over multiple
nodes to spread out the disk space usage.

All emails are stored encrypted and compressed on the storage node.
Emails are always accessed via the central master server.
