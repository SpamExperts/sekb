Archive historical data import
==============================

We're happy to import historical email data into your email archive. To
ensure this is done correctly:

1. Export the emails you wish us to import into `.eml
   format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail#Filename_extensions>`__
2. Separate the emails on domain, and create a .zip file for each domain
   containing all messages that belong to that domain (please provide a
   separate .zip for incoming and outgoing email if they should be
   imported specifically as such)
3. Contact our support with a method to access the .zip files
4. We will process all data for you and add them to the SpamExperts
   email archive

| There are many export tools available to convert your existing email
  to the open source .eml format.
| Alternatively, we can provide an IMAP account where you can copy the
  email messages to (1 folder for each domain) from your existing mail
  client if .eml export is not supported.
