Since version 2010, Office is also available in 64 bits. If you have a
64-bits Windows installed, you probably also have Office in 64 bits. In
order for the add-on to work, you should install the correct version
that matches your Outlook version.

For Outlook 2007 you have to use the 32 bits version.

How to check your Office version.
---------------------------------

First, open any Office application.  For example; Excel 2010, (This will
work in any other Office applications)  Open the File menu, and then
select Help.

On the right side, you’ll see your version information as well as other
information regarding the Office suite.

How to install the addon.
-------------------------

The download consists of 2 files. A "setup.exe" and a installation
".msi" file.  The setup.exe file is to be used if your workstation is
missing any of the requirements needed to run the .msi file.   This
includes a copy of Net Framework 4 and relevant runtime files.

-  Download the relevant .ZIP file according to your Office version.
-  Unzip the file to a temporary location
-  Proceed to run the extracted msi file. If you are using Microsoft
   Windows Vista or 7, then you should run the file with administrator
   priveledges. To do this, right click on the downloaded icon and
   choose '**Run as Administrator**\ '.
-  When you have reached Setup Wizard, click '**Next'** on the first
   page.
-  If the installer complains of missing requirements, quit the
   installation and run the setup.exe file.
-  You will be then presented with the location you wish to install the
   program.  The default settings here would be fine.
-  If you would like this addon to be available for your user account
   only, choose '**Just for me'**, otherwise click '**For Everyone**\ '
   and then click next.
-  The 'Disk Cost' button shows you the disk space availability on the
   PC.
-  Click 'Next' on the following screen to proceed to confirm the
   installation.
-  Your addon will then proceed to install.
-  Once installed restart your Microsoft Outlook, and your addon will be
   visible in the '**addins**\ ' tab.

If you are unable to see the addon after installation, go to
"**options**\ ", and then check to see if the **"Report Spam"** option
is added as a COM. If not you can go to “\ **COM Add-Ins**\ ” and check
**“ReportSpam”** and click OK.

| To report spam, select the message that passed the filter that you
  wish to report, and then click the '**Report Spam**\ ' button.
| The message will then be reported and moved to the '**Trash**\ '
  folder.
