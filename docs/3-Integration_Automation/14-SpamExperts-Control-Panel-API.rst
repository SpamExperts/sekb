SpamExperts Control Panel API
=============================

The SpamExperts Control Panel API can **only** be accessed by customers
with **administrator accounts**.

Using the **Control Panel API** allows you to automate the process of
adding/removing domains to your account, allowing your customers to use
a one- click-login solution or modify the settings of added domains. You
can also use this account with our range of add ons.

Your API username is your email address as registered in our customer
system.

If you can login at
`login.antispamcloud.com <https://login.antispamcloud.com/>`__ with your
given username and password, you can use it with the API as well.

In case your login is rejected, you can use the **"Retrieve log-in
link"** option to set a password.

Our `API Documentation <https://api.antispamcloud.com/api/help/>`__
contains all **API calls** that are available for use.
