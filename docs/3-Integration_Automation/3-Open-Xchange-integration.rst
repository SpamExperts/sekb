Open-Xchange integration
========================

Open-Xchange App Suite 7.6+
===========================

For details on how to integrate SpamExperts on your existing
Open-Xchange server, please
seeÂ \ `here <http://oxpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=Spamexperts>`__

Transparent integration
=======================

The SpamExperts Local Cloud solution can be transparently integrated
with Open-Xchange. This allows you to use the professional antispam
filtering of SpamExperts, whilst benefiting from the powerful
Open-Xchange frontend. To achieve this, only a few steps are required:

1. A global Sieve filtering rule should be added to your Open-Xchange
   setup, which automatically classifies each email with a
   "**X-Recommended-Action: reject**\ " header as spam
2. A small workaround can optionally be installed which will report
   emails classified as spam/not spam in Open-Xchange back to the
   SpamExperts systems to automatically fine-tune the filtering further

External integration
====================

OpenXchange can provide you with a special SpamExperts 'AntiSpam'
function which allows one-click-login access to the SpamExperts control
panel directly from Open-Xchange.
