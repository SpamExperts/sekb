HostBill Integration
====================

The SpamExperts integration is provided and maintained by our partners
at HostBill. You can access it via their `main extensions
page <http://hostbillapp.com/features/hosting-integrations/listing/>`__
or directly on the `SpamExperts integration
page <http://hostbillapp.com/products-services/spamexperts/>`__.

The HostBill SpamExperts integration is aimed at two user levels,
Reseller and Single User.

It allows users provision accounts, change domain count,
upgrade/downgrade resources, test connection and provision the
SpamExperts Incoming and Outgoing filtering.

**Single User Integration**

The Single User installation instructions can be found in the `HostBill
Knowledgebase <https://hostbill.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DOCS/SpamExperts>`__.

Single Users can manage domain aliases, email routes, auto-login in the
SpamExperts control panel and set the contact email.

**Reseller Integration**

The Reseller integration installation instructions can be found in the
`HostBill
Knowledgebase <https://hostbill.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DOCS/SpamExperts+Reseller>`__.

Resellers have access to the same features as Single Users but can also
upgrade/downgrade the domain limit, view domain statistics and
auto-login in the SpamExperts control panel.

For any issues or questions please `contact
HostBill <https://hostbillapp.com/company/contact/>`__.

SpamExperts is not responsible for the development and maintenance of
this integration.
