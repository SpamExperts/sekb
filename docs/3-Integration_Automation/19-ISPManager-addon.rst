ISPManager addon
================

Our partners at ISPSystem have developed the integration for SpamExperts
in ISPManager Pro, allowing you to add- and remove domains to a
SpamExperts appliance or Hosted Cloud account.

System requirements
-------------------

-  A SpamExperts Local Cloud appliance; or
-  A SpamExperts Hosted Cloud account with the Super Administrator API
   activated (`Requires
   action <https://my.spamexperts.com/kb/145/Using-addons-on-the-Hosted-Cloud.html>`__).
-  A ISPManager Pro server and admin access

Installation
------------

| In order to install the addon, you have to login to your ISPManager
  Pro interface with your Super-Admin account. Go to "**Server
  Settings**\ " -> "**Plug-Ins**\ ".
| Click the "**Install**\ " button in the top-right corner.
| The list of available addons will show. Select the "**SpamExperts**\ "
  module and click the "**Install**\ " button again.

| Read the warning, tick the checkbox and click **Next**.
| Depending on your current installed plugins, there might be some
  requirements (JSON, IDNA::PunyCode).
| The plugin system will detect this and ask you whether you'd like to
  install them. Click **Next**. The installation of these modules might
  take some time to complete.

After the installation, a new option will be available in the sidebar.
It might be required to reload the page for it to show up.

Usage Instructions
------------------

You can manage the domain's protection status using the SpamExperts
feature in the sidebar.

Removal Instructions
--------------------

If you want to remove the addon again, you can uninstall this from the
"**Server Settings**\ " -> "**Plug-ins**\ " overview.
