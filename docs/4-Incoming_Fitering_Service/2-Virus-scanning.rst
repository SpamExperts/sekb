Virus scanning
==============

Viruses, malware and other online threats often spread via email,
therefore it is important to virus-scan emails before they arrive to the
mail-client of a user. SpamExperts actively blocks both spam AND its
malicious attachments such as viruses, malware, ransomware, spyware and
so on.

Due to the fact that viruses generally try to spread as spam emails, the
majority of email viruses are already blocked before they are scanned
with our antivirus engine, because of our anti-spam technologies. Thanks
to this resource efficient and intuitive setup, even viruses not yet
known to virus scanners are generally, safely put away in quarantine or
rejected outright.

As an additional measure, we run the open-source ClamAV antivirus
framework, whose virus definitions are updated every 30 minutes. Besides
using the ClamAV databases, we have also added more datasets specialized
in email virus problems, provided by several external partners, to
ensure real-time, optimal protection against the latest virus outbreaks.
Our internal reputation systems also contribute to virus scanning and
ensure optimal protection against not only spam, but also malware,
phishing, and viruses.
