Report Spam
===========

If you are still receiving spam, submitting the emails to the central
SpamExperts training system will first of all help to reduce the spam
you're seeing, and it will allow us to retrieve detailed information on
what may be causing your problems. Emails that did not pass our
filtering systems, or that passed the filters because the
sender/recipient was whitelisted are automatically excluded from the
training systems.

Methods to report spam

  You can upload a spam message on the page to train the anti-spam
  filter. It is a 'drag 'n' drop' feature, meaning you can save the Spam
  email to your system, then drag and drop the email into the "Report
  Spam" area.
