Configure Outlook to access the IMAP quarantine
===============================================

Configuring your mailclient

If you want to use our IMAP quarantine & training system in your
mailclient, you have to configure this.

Use the following settings to configure your IMAP account in Outlook. In
case you are using the SpamExperts hosted platform, you have to use
"quarantine.antispamcloud.com" as IMAP server, use username
"mydomainname.com" (replace with your own domain name), and use the
password you have set for the domain user.

For Local Cloud users, you will need to replace
"**quarantine.antispamcloud.com**\ " with your master servers hostname.

These steps are also the same / similar for Outlook 2007.

Please note, that in Outlook 2013 & Outlook 2016 there are issues when
using the IMAP quarantine.  We have contacted them about this, however
as yet a fix has not been provided.

Open your account settings. In 2010 this is located in the File ->
Account Settings -> Account Settings.

Select manual configuration.

Choose "Internet E-Mail"

|image2|

Enter your information. The password used is the password you use to
login at
`http://login.antispamcloud.com <http://login.antispamcloud.com/%20"http://login.spamexperts.com">`__
for that domainname. If you do not have your password, you can
`retrieve <https://login.antispamcloud.com/lostpassword.php%20"https://login.spamexperts.com/lostpassword.php">`__
it.

Click on "More Settings" to give the account a better name such as
"Training Account".

|image4|

Close the window and finish the wizard.

|image5|

You're done!

If everything went correct, you will see these folders in your sidebar.

Outlook 2011 Apple-Mac
----------------------

The configuration above will also work for Office 2011 Mac version,
however to see the full list of subscribed IMAP folders you need to
change one setting:

-  Navigate to '**Preferences**\ '
-  Click on '**General**\ '
-  Uncheck the box that says '**Group Similar Folders**\ '

You should now be able to see the full list of IMAP folders in the left
pane window.
