Using addons on the Hosted Cloud
================================

Hosted Cloud users who want to use any of our compatible add-ons require
API access.

The API credentials will be your administrator email address & password
used to login to your client area.

The configuration details for our Hosted Cloud are:

-  Spampanel URL: https://api.antispamcloud.com (or your own hostname in
   case you have whitelabel)
-  API Hostname: api.antispamcloud.com
-  API Username: your email address
-  API Password: the password you've set earlier for my.spamexperts.com
   / login.antispamcloud.com

If you do not have Private Label on the **Hosted Cloud solution** or in
case your **Custom MX records** are not setup, you can use the following
hostnames:

-  Primary MX: mx.spamexperts.com
-  Secondary MX: fallbackmx.spamexperts.eu
-  Third MX: lastmx.spamexperts.net

Once everything is configured, the add-on is ready to use.
