===============================

If you want to use any of our add-ons on the Local Cloud, Control Panel
API access is required.

The configuration details for our Local Cloud are:

-  **Control Panel URL**: https://master.hostname
-  **API Hostname**: master.hostname
-  **API Username**: your Administrator Username \*
-  **API Password**: the password you've set earlier for the above user

\*\ **Be advised**: The API Username should be a user with access to the
Control Panel API, such as an Administrator. You should not use a
Super-Administrator or Software API user.

We recommend to perform the following actions:

-  Add an Admin account via the web interface or API for each server.
-  Transfer the domains to each Admin - required only if the domains are
   not already assigned to the Admin accounts.
-  Use the Admin accounts to manage your domains.

Once you have everything configured, you can start using the add-on.
