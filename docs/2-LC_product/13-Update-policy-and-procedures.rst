Update policy and procedures
============================

Update build day/time
=====================

SpamExperts publishes a new stable build of its Local Cloud product
every Tuesday 11:00am UTC. All Local Cloud servers will automatically
update themselves at the set update day/time. Since the Local Cloud
product is provided as a SaaS solution, it's not possible to skip an
update build since that would break the central management of your
cluster and the real-time anti-spam data feeds.

New Features and Bug fixes
==========================

Every new build may contain fixes for known bugs and/or include new
features. The changelog shows an overview of the changes for each
published build. These are also announced in the weekly update email
sent out on Thursday.

API changes
===========

We offer backwards compatibility to any API changes, as deprecated calls
will remain available for a minimum of 4 months, and will return a
deprecation warning message.
