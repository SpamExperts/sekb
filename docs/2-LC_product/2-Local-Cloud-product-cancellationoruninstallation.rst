Local Cloud product cancellation/uninstallation
===============================================

Cancellation procedure
----------------------

All steps described here apply only to the Local Cloud filtering
service.

To cancel the product you have to complete a few steps, as follows:

Cancel the product
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First cancel the product in our `customer
portal <https://my.spamexperts.com/>`__. Our billing department will
receive the request, and will accept (or deny) it depending on whether
the cancellation terms have been met.

At this point, you should keep your servers online and reachable for our
System Administrators to properly remove the product.

Uninstallation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In all cases, the SpamExperts System Administrators should be able to
uninstall our software from your servers. For this, your servers have to
be online and reachable.

The uninstallation is done quickly and will remove all of the installed
applications and data.

After the uninstallation, we will turn the servers off and let you know
when this is done. Please note that as long as weâ€™re unable to uninstall
the servers, the contract cannot be cancelled.
