Hardware Requirements
=====================

Hardware requirements strictly depend on how much traffic the solution
will filter, thus different configurations may apply to different
customers.

Determining required hardware
=============================

Since our Local Cloud solution runs on your own hardware, it is useful
to estimate in advance how much hardware you may need to have sufficient
capacity for a redundant environment. Estimating hardware requirements
can be difficult due to differences in email patterns across
countries/companies. For more information on the actual setup structure,
please see
`Clustering <https://my.spamexperts.com/kb/69/Clustering.html>`__.

With hardware there is always a bottleneck: CPU, memory, or disk IO. We
generally noticed that fast disks (SAS/SSD) greatly improve the
connection/email throughput per server. The amount of memory determines
the number of concurrent connections that can be processed, you
generally wonâ€™t need more than 64GB per server (and minimum 4GB). CPU is
used mainly for content/virus scanning and analyses, and when sufficient
memory/disk IO will likely be the next bottleneck.

**If you need help with your hardware requirements, provide us with the
following details:**

-  Total number of email/domains or hosting accounts
-  Average number of incoming connections per day (if available)
-  Average number of legitimate email (not spam) deliveries per day

Trial installation recommendations
==================================

hardware configuration may be necessary, depending on your email
traffic.
