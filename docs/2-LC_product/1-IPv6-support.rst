IPv6 support
============

The SpamExperts solution fully supports IPv6.

If the IPv6 addresses were not present at setup of your cluster, please
provide the details to our support team to have them added to the
configuration. Ensure your server hostname points to the primary A
record (1) and includes all AAAA records (1 or more) for the IPv6
addresses.

We recommend that your domains always have at least 1 MX record without
AAAA records for now to avoid compatibility issues with bad IPv6
senders.
