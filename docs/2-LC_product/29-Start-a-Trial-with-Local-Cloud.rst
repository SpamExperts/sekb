Start a Trial with Local Cloud
==============================

The Local Cloud product can be tested on our demo server which is
publicly accessible for everyone, as detailed below.

If you want to start a trial for testing real traffic with our Incoming
and Outgoing filters or Email Archiving, we recommend to use our Hosted
Cloud instead which uses the same filtering technologies / data. To
access this please register for the `Hosted Cloud
trial <https://my.spamexperts.com/cart.php?a=add&pid=2>`__ which offers
21 days of free access.

Local Cloud demo server
-----------------------

Below you find the access details to the SpamExperts Local Cloud demo
server. You can see the control panel, the various branding options, as
well as the API help giving an overview of all API calls.

-  Webinterface: `demo1.spambrand.com <http://demo1.spambrand.com/>`__
-  Username: admin
-  Password: demo
-  Software API overview:
   https://demo1.spambrand.com/cgi-bin/api?call=api_help (same user and
   password)
-  SpamExperts Control Panel API overview (JSON):

Be Advised: The publicly accessible demo server should never be used for
live traffic as others have access with the same credentials. For live
traffic testing please use the `Hosted Cloud
