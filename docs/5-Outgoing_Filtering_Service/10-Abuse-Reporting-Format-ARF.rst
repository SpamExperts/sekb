Abuse Reporting Format (ARF)
============================

What are ARF reports?
---------------------

An ARF (Abuse Reporting Format) report is an email format abuse report
generated every time an outgoing sender's message gets blocked.

How do I set this?
------------------

This can be set by adding the email address you wish to use at the
domain's settings page of each domain under the 'Administrator contact',
or by setting the Clusters default Administrator contact.

Why should I use this?
----------------------

Using these reports are extremely useful for closing down spammers in
your network, giving you an alert each time a spam message is sent.Â 
Each report contains the message that was blocked as an attachment, as
well as information regarding the outbound sender account that was used
and a time stamp.

What else should I know?
------------------------

We recommend adding the email address you are using to the recipient
whitelist, as the AFR reports contains a copy of the spam message that
was blocked, and this can cause the reports to be blocked by the
incoming filter. Alternatively you can use an email address designed for
this, that does not have any filtering on this address.
