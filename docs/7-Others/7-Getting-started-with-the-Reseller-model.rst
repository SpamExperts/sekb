Account Credit
--------------

It is important to note that your first required payment will be
credited towards your account. Once payment of the account-credit is
received, our billing department will add this as credit to your
account. The credit will be used to partially pay future invoices. Once
all credit is used, you will be responsible to fulfill payment of
invoices. SpamExperts will not create an invoice for the initial account
credit, since this is a credit and, accounting wise, it should be seen
as a prepayment for future invoices.

Upon receiving the Reseller agreement, signed by both SpamExperts and
you as Reseller, our billing department will notify you about the
billing procedures via email, as described below:

In order to fulfill payment of the account credit, you are required to:

-  Choose a payment option

   payment is fulfilled
