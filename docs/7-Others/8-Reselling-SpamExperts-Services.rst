Reselling SpamExperts Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reseller/Distributor Agreement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our General Terms & Conditions specify that reselling of our services is
not allowed without written approval. In case you are interested in
reselling our services, please contact sales@spamexperts.com to receive
our Reseller/Distributor agreement. We offer highly competitive
Pay-As-You-Go domain-based reseller options with one of the highest
margins on email- security in the market!

Reselling with a bulk-license for Webhosts / ISPs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| If you currently have a domain-based bulk (package) license for
  webhosts or ISPs, you are not allowed to resell the solutions to
  end-clients. The bulk- licenses are primarily intended to bulk-protect
  entire (webhosting/ ISP) infrastructures, with all domains/ users
  included.
| As valued partners, we understand that you may want to offset some of
  your investments through reselling to (a subset of) your clients or
  third-parties. Although that's not allowed with our bulk-licenses,
  please contact us with your reselling plan so we can evaluate it, by
  sending a short email to sales@spamexperts.com. It's important to us
  that such offering does not conflict with our existing
  reseller/distributor partner model and pricing, however to keep things
  simple we like to take a flexible approach where possible. We
  appreciate your understanding in the matter and look forward hearing
  from you!
