How to pay my invoice
=====================

SpamExperts has outsourced and automated all payment collection
processes to both Paypal and Stripe. The reason for this is simple. With
clients in over 80 countries, it allows us to further automate our
financial administration and reduce overhead. Consequently, we are
enabled to continue offering our products at the most competitive rates
possible. If your organization does not support our default (online)
payment options,you can always opt for a Direct Bank Transfer.

| Ensure to mention your invoice number as reference when making a
  Direct Bank Transfer into our account. This ensures tracing of your
  payment.
| Please always ensure the full invoice amount arrives at our
  bank-account and assume any transfer related banking costs at your own
  expense.
| NOTE: as we would have to process your payment manually, processing
  your payment may take up to 2 weeks after receiving your payment into
  our bank- accounts. We cannot guarantee that this avoids account
  and/or service suspension in case of late payment.

Billing contact
---------------

As you may not be directly responsible yourself for fulfilling the
payments, you can now make sure that your billing contact is added to
your account as well as having permissions to log-in, view, and pay the
open invoices.

In order to arrange for this, please take the following steps:

-  Log in at the following url: https://my.spamexperts.com.
-  Under "Client Area", go to "Manage Contacts".
-  There you can define (a) who in your organization should receive
   which types of email and (b) whether these people should also have a
   sub-account with log in rights and which rights they will get
   assigned. (For instance, in order to manage your products or view and
   pay invoices.)
